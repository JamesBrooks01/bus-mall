# Bus Mall

An app designed to show 1-9 random images from a set with the number displayed decided by a form submission, with none of the images showing up consecutively. Then after choosing from one of the displayed images a certain number of times in a row, you can press a button and view in a bar chart the number of times an image was viewed and how many times it was clicked.
